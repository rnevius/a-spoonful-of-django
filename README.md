# A Spoonful of Django

Welcome to **A Spoonful of Django**, a continuously-evolving repository of best practices for the latest official version of Django. 

This repository includes recommentations for coding styles, patterns, and decisions. While this repo is here to represent best practices (something that is very subjective at times), many developers may disagree with some or many of the choices listed here. There is no single, correct method for developing Django projects. Be sure to make your own decisions, if something recommended here isn't sitting right with you.

As you have probably noticed by now, this repo is very much a work in progress. If you have a suggestion or improvement, please open up an issue and submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome!
