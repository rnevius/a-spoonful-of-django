# Local Django Environment Setup Best Practices

1. Use the same database engine everywhere
  * Don't use MySQL in your development environment, and PostgreSQL in production.
2. Use **virtualenv** or **virtualenvwrapper** 
3. Use **pip** to install Django and dependencies
4. Use **git** to keep all development and production files version controlled
